You need to start a [free balenaCloud account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup) for the deploy method to work. Your first ten devices on balenaCloud are fully-featured, free of charge, and don't require a payment method to start.

## Deploy using balenaCLI

If you prefer to use our CLI method to deploy this project, follow these instructions.

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://balena.io/) and follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started).
- Clone [this repository](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-cam) to your local workspace.
- Unset (delete) the environment variable `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` or `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` if exists, from the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab.
- Set these variables in the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab
  - `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_start_x` = `1`
  - Set all the following `gpu_mem` variables so your Pi can autoselect how much memory to allocate for hardware accelerated graphics, based on how much RAM it has available

    | Key                                  | Value
    |--------------------------------------|----------
    |**`BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem_256`**  | **`192`**
    |**`BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem_512`**  | **`256`**
    |**`BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem_1024`** | **`448`**
- Using [balenaCLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code with `balena push <application-name>`.
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!
